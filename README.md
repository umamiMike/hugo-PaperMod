This is a Fork of [adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)

It has mostly been for my own experimentation, so many things are in a WIP state. I welcome feedback. You can demo it [here](https://umamimike.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/).

As I was working on this, I diverged enough with some work that I felt uncomfortable trying to PR upstream until I had codified the changes. 

## New features
